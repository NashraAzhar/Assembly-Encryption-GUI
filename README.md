# Assembly-Encryption-GUI
A hybrid cryptographic system integrating 8086 Assembly logic with a C++ Win32 GUI for secure data encryption and decryption
SecureTrans: 8086 Assembly & C++ Hybrid Cryptosystem
Project Overview: A hybrid system that bridges low-level processor logic with a high-level user interface.
Key Features:
Core Logic: Developed in 8086 Assembly for efficient character mapping using the XLAT instruction.
User Interface: Built using C++ Win32 API to provide a seamless graphical experience.
Security: Implements a bi-directional substitution cipher for both lowercase and uppercase characters.
